# Expense App

This application was created as part of a 2-week internship with a local
technology company. The application is meant to be run as a Microsoft Teams
application.

The application is designed to track the expenses of a particular location. An
approver, usually the head of a particular office location, is given authority
to view all expense reports submitted by employees. The approver can then
approve or reject the report. If rejected, the employee is provided information
on why a particular expense report was rejected. If accepted and after claiming
that particular expense, the approver can mark the report as paid. Employees
also have the option to save reports without submitting it to the approver.

There is also an admin page that allows elements in the expense forms itself
to be updated like the different categories. THis page also allows approvers to
be selected among users.

The app breaks the company into different locations that correspond to physical
locations of the company and each location has only 1 approver. New locations
can be added in the admin page.
